# OhData-Client
OhData Client - Consume OData in an easy and powerful way

# What is OData and what is the idea of this library
[OData]<http://www.odata.org/> is an "open protocol to allow the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs in a simple and standard way."
It has the official slogan "the best way to REST". It is quite powerful and has various benefits, but also has it's downsides and complexities. 
I personally like OData and made good experience in the .NET world, but the in the Java world it is not so easy to use. 
"OhData Client" uses the most familiar OData library Olingo and builds on top a powerful library that makes it possible to consume OData V2 services in a few seconds. 
Come in and see with your own eyes.

#What OData version do you support   
This is one of the disadvantages. There are various versions of OData. The most used ones are V2 and V4. This OhData Client library currently only supports V2, but as soon as we have finished this we will continue with V4.
